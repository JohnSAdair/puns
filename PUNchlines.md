# PUNchlines
Jokes with pun-based punchlines. Longer than one-liners.

## Tomato Family
- Three tomatoes are walking down the street- a poppa tomato, a momma tomato, and a little baby tomato. Baby tomato starts lagging behind. Poppa tomato gets really angry, goes over to the baby tomato, and smooshes  him... and says, 'ketchup!'

## Smooth-ie Talker
- Somebody walks into a bar and orders a fruity mixed drink. They take a shot and wince in pain as it goes down. They shout "wow, that really packs a punch!"

## Oh No UDP Didn't
 - $ Hi, would you like to hear a UDP joke?
 - # Yes, I would like to hear a UDP joke.
 - $ "No charge!"
 - $ "Bartender, how much do I owe you?"
 - $ "For you, neutron?"
 - $ "A neutron walks into a bar..."
 - (The best part is $ doesn't know or care if # even got the joke)
