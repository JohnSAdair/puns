# PUNchlines
Jokes with pun-based punchlines. Longer than one-liners.

## Tomato Family
- Three tomatoes are walking down the street- a poppa tomato, a momma tomato, and a little baby tomato. Baby tomato starts lagging behind. Poppa tomato gets really angry, goes over to the baby tomato, and smooshes  him... and says, 'ketchup!'

## Smooth-ie Talker
- Somebody walks into a bar and orders a fruity mixed drink. They take a shot and wince in pain as it goes down. They shout "wow, that really packs a punch!"
